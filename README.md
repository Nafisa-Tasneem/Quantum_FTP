# Quantum FTP
Simple File Transfer Module Using Python's Socket Module. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server. This program does not follow the real RFC for FTP, rather this is a simple file transfer system for learning purpose. 

This project has been done for the purpose of **ECE 4110 Computer Networks Lab** course. You are free to use and change the codes.
